# 🧩 **Claude-Sonnet 4.5 Stretch & Optional Goals Prompt**

## 🎯 **Purpose**

You are now entering the **enhancement and optimization phase** of the Pomodoro Timer iOS app project.
The core MVP has been delivered — timer, customization, persistence, and notifications are working.

Your task is to **incrementally implement stretch goals**, ensuring backward compatibility, maintainability, and adherence to Apple’s HIG.

You must continue tracking all progress using your **persistent task tracker** and **📘 Memory Update / ▶️ Next Action** cycle.

## ⚙️ **Stretch Goals Overview**

Prioritize features based on **impact → feasibility → delight**.

### 🏆 Tier 1 (High-Impact, Low Risk)

1. **Apple Watch Companion App**

   * Mirror main timer with start/pause/reset.
   * Handoff session control between iPhone and Watch.
   * Use `WatchConnectivity` and `WidgetKit` where relevant.

2. **Siri Shortcuts Integration**

   * Add intents:

     * “Start Pomodoro”, “Pause Pomodoro”, “Show stats”.
   * Implement with `AppIntents` framework.

3. **WidgetKit Integration**

   * Create home screen and lock screen widgets showing:

     * Active timer countdown.
     * Daily Pomodoro count.
   * Keep energy-efficient, glanceable, and visually minimal.

---

### 🌥️ Tier 2 (Moderate Complexity)

4. **Focus Mode Integration**

   * Detect and optionally align sessions with iOS Focus status.
   * Example: start Focus Mode automatically during Pomodoro.
   * Use `FocusStatusCenter` API.

5. **Cloud Sync (iCloud / CloudKit)**

   * Sync preferences and statistics between devices.
   * Handle conflicts gracefully (last-write-wins or merge).

6. **Enhanced Analytics**

   * Weekly charts, streak visualizations.
   * Use `Charts` framework in SwiftUI.

---

### 🚀 Tier 3 (Delight / Differentiation)

7. **Gamification Layer**

   * Streak rewards, badges, or motivational quotes.
   * Persist badges locally or with iCloud.

8. **Haptics & Sound Packs**

   * Custom feedback patterns.
   * Themed sound libraries (minimal, classic, playful).

9. **Theme Marketplace / Editor**

   * User-generated or downloadable themes.
   * Manage through local data store.

## 🧭 **Agent Workflow for Stretch Goals**

### Step 1 — Prioritization

* Evaluate each optional feature for **value vs complexity**.
* Present a **ranked priority list** and proposed implementation order.
* Update the **task tracker** accordingly.

### Step 2 — Integration Planning

* For each new feature:

  * Define dependencies and architectural touchpoints.
  * Ensure modular design — isolated Swift packages or feature modules.

### Step 3 — Incremental Implementation

* Implement **one stretch feature at a time**.
* After each, test for:

  * Regression in core functionality.
  * Performance and battery impact.
  * UI coherence (no clutter).

### Step 4 — Validation & Polishing

* Document new settings or user-facing features.
* Update README and help screen.
* Revise App Store metadata.

---

## 🧠 **Agent Persistence Rules (same as before)**

* Maintain the **task tracker** and **Memory Update** sections.
* For each stretch feature:

  * Summarize the design decision.
  * Note potential trade-offs or future extensions.
* Continue to output:

  * **📘 Memory Update** — new progress and context.
  * **▶️ Next Action** — what feature to tackle next.

---

## 🧾 **Deliverables for Stretch Phase**

* Updated codebase with optional features implemented.
* README + feature summary table.
* Regression test results.
* Updated App Store assets (new screenshots for added functionality).

## ▶️ **Kickoff Instruction**

> Begin the stretch-goal phase.
>
> 1. Evaluate all optional features listed above.
> 2. Rank them by **feasibility and impact**.
> 3. Propose an **implementation roadmap** (Tier 1 → Tier 3).
> 4. Update the **task tracker** and start with the top priority feature (most impactful, least risky).
> 5. After implementation, perform a regression test and output your **📘 Memory Update** and **▶️ Next Action**.
