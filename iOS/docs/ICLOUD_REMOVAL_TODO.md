# iCloud Sync Removal - Documentation Update TODO

## Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

The iCloud sync feature has been hidden from the UI and removed from user-facing materials (README, website). However, the extensive documentation in the `docs/` folder still contains numerous references to iCloud sync that should be updated for consistency.

## Completed Updates

### âœ… Code
- `PomodoroTimer/Views/SettingsView.swift` - iCloud section commented out (line 95)

### âœ… Main Documentation
- `README.md` - Removed iCloud sync feature section and all references

### âœ… Website Files
- `website/www/index.html` - Removed iCloud feature card and hero pill
- `website/www/contact.html` - Updated FAQ about device sync
- `website/www/privacy.html` - Removed iCloud sync sections

## Pending Updates - Documentation Files

The following files contain **87 total iCloud references** that should be updated:

### ðŸ“„ docs/USER_GUIDE.md (~30 references)
- Complete "iCloud Sync" section (lines describing setup, troubleshooting)
- FAQ section mentions of iCloud
- Privacy section mentions
- Troubleshooting section

### ðŸ“„ docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (~25 references)
- "iCloud Integration" major section with CloudKit setup
- Architecture mentions of CloudSyncManager
- Testing iCloud section
- Prerequisites mentioning iCloud

### ðŸ“„ docs/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md (~20 references)
- App description mentions
- Feature list includes iCloud
- Privacy section mentions
- Screenshot descriptions
- Marketing copy

### ðŸ“„ docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (minimal references)
- Brief mentions in context

### ðŸ“„ docs/README.md (~5 references)
- Navigation mentions iCloud features
- Quick links

### ðŸ“„ docs/SCREENSHOT_PREPARATION.md (minimal references)
- Note about iCloud being disabled during screenshot mode

## Recommendation

Due to the extensive nature of these documentation updates (87 references across multiple large files), consider one of these approaches:

1. **Quick Fix**: Add a prominent note at the top of each doc file stating "Note: iCloud sync is currently disabled and under development. References in this document are for future implementation."

2. **Comprehensive Update**: Systematically go through each documentation file and remove/update iCloud references (time-intensive but cleaner).

3. **Phased Approach**: Update critical user-facing docs (USER_GUIDE, APP_STORE_SUBMISSION) first, leave developer docs as-is for future reference.

## Notes

- The CloudSyncManager.swift service file still exists in the codebase - it's just not accessible from the UI
- The iCloud capability may still be configured in the Xcode project
- Consider whether to keep the code for future reactivation or remove it entirely
