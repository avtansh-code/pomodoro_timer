### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This approach helps you:

- 🎯 Maintain focus and concentration
- 💪 Prevent burnout and fatigue

- ⏱️ Track your productivity over time

### First Launch

5. **Take a break** - The app automatically switches to break mode

### Basic Navigation

The app has three main screens accessible via the tab bar:

- **🍅 Timer** - Your main workspace with the countdown timer
- **📊 Stats** - Track your progress and view statistics
- **⚙️ Settings** - Customize the app to your preferences
