**Effective Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Mr. Pomodoro ("we," "our," or "the app"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, use, and storage.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Mr. Pomodoro is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your productivity data should remain yours, stored securely on your device with optional iCloud sync that you control.

## What Data We Collect

### Locally Stored Data

The app stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Timer Settings**: Your preferences for focus duration, break lengths, number of sessions, sound/haptic settings, theme preferences, and notification settings
- **Session History**: Records of completed Pomodoro sessions including session type (focus/break), duration, and completion timestamp
- **Statistics**: Calculated metrics derived from your session history (daily streaks, weekly/monthly totals)
- **Focus Mode Settings**: Preferences for iOS Focus Mode integration

### Optional iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync in the app settings:

- Timer settings and session history are synced to **your private iCloud account**
- Data is stored in **your personal iCloud storage** using Apple's CloudKit framework
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest using Apple's security infrastructure
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in Settings

## What We DO NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we don't do:
