## üìù Coding Standards

### iOS (Swift)

**Follow Swift API Design Guidelines:**

```swift
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, descriptive names
func startFocusSession(duration: TimeInterval)
var completedSessionsCount: Int

// ‚ùå Avoid: Abbreviations and unclear names
func strtSes(dur: TimeInterval)
var cnt: Int
```

**Code Style:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use `// MARK:` for code organization
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Use `guard` for early returns
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible

**Architecture:**
- Follow MVVM pattern
- Keep ViewModels testable (no UIKit dependencies)
- Use dependency injection
- Separate business logic from UI

### Android (Kotlin)

**Follow Kotlin Coding Conventions:**

```kotlin
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear naming and structure
fun startFocusSession(duration: Duration)
val completedSessionsCount: Int

// ‚ùå Avoid: Poor naming
fun strt(d: Duration)
var cnt: Int
```

**Code Style:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use KDoc for public APIs
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Use Jetpack Compose best practices

**Architecture:**
- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Maintain clear layer separation (Domain/Data/Presentation)
- Use Hilt for dependency injection
- Use StateFlow for reactive state
- Write unit tests for business logic

### General Best Practices

- **Write self-documenting code** with clear variable/function names
- **Keep functions small** and focused (single responsibility)
- **Avoid magic numbers** - use named constants
- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper error handling
- **Write defensive code** with input validation
- **Comment complex logic** but prefer clear code over comments
- **Follow DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Optimize for readability** over cleverness

## üí¨ Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear commit history.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies

### Examples

```bash

- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Reference issues and PRs in the body when applicable
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how* (code shows how)

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

**iOS (XCTest):**

```swift
class TimerManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    var sut: TimerManager!
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        sut = TimerManager()
    }
    
    func testStartTimer_UpdatesState() {
        // Given
        let duration: TimeInterval = 1500
        
        // When
        sut.startTimer(duration: duration)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(sut.state, .running)
        XCTAssertEqual(sut.remainingTime, duration)
    }
}
```

**Android (JUnit):**

```kotlin
class TimerManagerTest {
    private lateinit var timerManager: TimerManager
    
    @Before
    fun setup() {
        timerManager = TimerManager()
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `startTimer updates state correctly`() {
        // Given
        val duration = 1500L
        
        // When
        timerManager.startTimer(duration)
        
        // Then
        assertEquals(TimerState.RUNNING, timerManager.state.value)
        assertEquals(duration, timerManager.remainingTime.value)
    }
}
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for **60%+ overall coverage**
- **80%+ coverage** for domain/business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Write integration tests for critical flows
- UI tests for key user journeys

### Running Tests

**iOS:**
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -project PomodoroTimer.xcodeproj -scheme PomodoroTimer

# Run specific test
xcodebuild test -project PomodoroTimer.xcodeproj -scheme PomodoroTimer -only-testing:PomodoroTimerTests/TimerManagerTests
```

**Android:**
```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests TimerManagerTest

# Run with coverage
./gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverage
```

### Code Documentation

**iOS (Swift DocC):**

```swift
/// Starts a new focus session with the specified duration.
///
/// This method initializes a new Pomodoro session and begins the countdown timer.
/// The timer will continue running even if the app is backgrounded.
///
/// - Parameter duration: The length of the focus session in seconds.
/// - Throws: `TimerError.alreadyRunning` if a session is already in progress.
/// - Note: Call `stopTimer()` to cancel the session before it completes.
func startFocusSession(duration: TimeInterval) throws {
    // Implementation
}
