## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a proven time management method that breaks work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

**How it works:**
1. Choose a task to focus on
2. Start a 25-minute focus session
3. Work without distractions until the timer ends
4. Take a 5-minute break
5. After 4 focus sessions, take a longer 15-minute break
6. Repeat and build momentum

This simple approach helps improve focus, reduce mental fatigue, increase productivity, and build sustainable work habits.
