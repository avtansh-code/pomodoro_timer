# 
# Light Mode:
# - splash_logo.png (512x512 - main splash logo)

#
# Design Guidelines:
# - Use simple, centered design
# - Logo should work on colored background
# - Ensure good contrast for both light/dark
# - Keep file sizes small for fast loading
# - Use PNG format with transparency
#
# After creating splash assets, run:
# flutter pub get
# flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
#
# To remove splash (if needed):
# flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:remove
