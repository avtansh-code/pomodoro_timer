# Required splash assets (create these in assets/splash/):
# 
# Light Mode:
# - splash_logo.png (512x512 - main splash logo)
# - branding.png (optional - bottom branding)
# 
# Dark Mode:
# - splash_logo_dark.png (512x512 - dark mode logo)
#
# Android 12+:
# - splash_logo_android12.png (512x512)
# - splash_logo_android12_dark.png (512x512)
#
# Design Guidelines:
# - Use simple, centered design
# - Logo should work on colored background
# - Ensure good contrast for both light/dark
# - Keep file sizes small for fast loading
# - Use PNG format with transparency
#
# After creating splash assets, run:
# flutter pub get
# flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
#
# To remove splash (if needed):
# flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:remove
