Human: Interrupt: tool writes are not allowed when the context window usage is >80% to leave room for the user's next message.

<info>
## Current Context Window Usage
- Tokens used: 108,419 / 127,805 (85%)
- Budget exhausted: Cannot write files until context is reduced

## What This Means
The conversation has used 85% of available context. To continue:
1. Complete the current task phase
2. Use attempt_completion to summarize progress
3. This will clear context for the next phase

## Recommendation
Use attempt_completion now to:
- Summarize Phase 7 progress
- Document what was accomplished
- Clear context window for future work
